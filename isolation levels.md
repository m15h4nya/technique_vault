In PostgreSQL, isolation levels define how transactions interact with each other in a multi-user environment. These levels ensure the consistency and integrity of the database when multiple transactions are being executed concurrently. PostgreSQL supports different isolation levels conforming to the SQL standard, each providing a different level of consistency, concurrency, and performance trade-offs. Here are the isolation levels supported by PostgreSQL:

1. **Read Uncommitted (Level 0):**
    
    - In this isolation level, transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions.
    - It offers the lowest level of isolation and does not provide any isolation from dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, or phantom reads.
    - PostgreSQL does not support this isolation level directly. Even when a transaction is set to read uncommitted, PostgreSQL effectively behaves like Read Committed.
2. **Read Committed (Level 1):**
    
    - In Read Committed isolation level, a transaction can only see changes committed by other transactions. It prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
    - This is the default isolation level in PostgreSQL. Each query within a transaction sees only changes committed before the query began.
    - Read Committed provides better concurrency compared to Read Uncommitted but may still encounter anomalies like non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.
3. **Repeatable Read (Level 2):**
    
    - In Repeatable Read isolation level, a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database as it existed at the start of the transaction. Any changes made by other transactions after the current transaction began are not visible.
    - It prevents dirty reads and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.
    - PostgreSQL uses multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) to implement Repeatable Read isolation.
4. **Serializable (Level 3):**
    
    - Serializable is the highest isolation level in PostgreSQL, providing the strongest guarantees for data consistency and integrity.
    - Transactions appear to execute serially, as if there were no other concurrent transactions modifying the same data. This ensures that each transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database.
    - Serializable isolation level prevents dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads by effectively serializing the execution of transactions.

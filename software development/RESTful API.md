It seems like you're asking about the principles for building RESTful APIs. REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Here are some key principles for RESTful APIs:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between the client and server. The client is responsible for the user interface and user experience, while the server is responsible for data storage and processing.

2. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand the request. The server should not store any client state between requests. This simplifies server design and allows for scalability.

3. **Uniform Interface**: Use of a uniform and consistent interface between components. This typically includes resources identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers), the use of standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and representation of resources in standard formats such as JSON or XML.

4. **Cacheability**: Responses from the server should indicate whether they can be cached by the client or intermediate caches. This helps improve performance and scalability by reducing the need for redundant requests to the server.

5. **Layered System**: The architecture should be composed of multiple layers, each with a specific responsibility. This allows for flexibility and scalability, as well as promoting reuse of components.

6. **Code on Demand (optional)**: Servers can optionally provide executable code to clients in the form of applets or scripts. However, this is not a required constraint for RESTful APIs.

By following these principles, developers can design APIs that are scalable, flexible, and interoperable, enabling seamless communication between clients and servers over the internet.

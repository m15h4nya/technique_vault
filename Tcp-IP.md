## Layers
>The Internet protocol suite provides [end-to-end data communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_principle "End-to-end principle") specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, [routed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing "Routing"), and received. This functionality is organized into four [abstraction layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_layer "Abstraction layer"), which classify all related protocols according to each protocol's scope of networking. An implementation of the layers for a particular application forms a [protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack "Protocol stack"). From lowest to highest, the layers are the [link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer "Link layer"), containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the [internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer "Internet layer"), providing [internetworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking "Internetworking") between independent networks; the [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer"), handling host-to-host communication; and the [application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer "Application layer"), providing process-to-process data exchange for applications.

>- The [application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer "Application layer") is the scope within which applications, or [processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_(computing) "Process (computing)"), create user data and communicate this data to other applications on another or the same host. The applications make use of the services provided by the underlying lower layers, especially the transport layer which provides [reliable or unreliable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_(computer_networking) "Reliability (computer networking)") _pipes_ to other processes. The communications partners are characterized by the application architecture, such as the [client–server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model "Client–server model") and [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer") networking. This is the layer in which all application protocols, such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, operate. Processes are addressed via ports which essentially represent [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(systems_architecture) "Service (systems architecture)").
>- The [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer") performs host-to-host communications on either the local network or remote networks separated by routers. It provides a channel for the communication needs of applications. UDP is the basic transport layer protocol, providing an unreliable [connectionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication "Connectionless communication") datagram service. The Transmission Control Protocol provides flow-control, connection establishment, and reliable transmission of data.
>- The [internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer "Internet layer") exchanges datagrams across network boundaries. It provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) of the underlying network connections. It is therefore also the layer that establishes internetworking. Indeed, it defines and establishes the Internet. This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which defines [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address"). Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next host, functioning as an IP router, that has the connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.
>- The [link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer "Link layer") defines the networking methods within the scope of the local network link on which hosts communicate without intervening routers. This layer includes the protocols used to describe the local network topology and the interfaces needed to effect the transmission of internet layer datagrams to next-neighbor hosts.
